## What is the problem you are trying to solve?
I am creating a website that showscases an iOS app that I want to build. By doing so i will demonstrate my ability to create elegant websites and my UX/UI design skills.

## Who is the target audience?
* Everyone that is interested in a reminder app for iOS.
* People that often forget or are not sure that they locked their house/workspace.

## What are your specific goals?
Make a really good-looking website. Functionality wise the app shouldnâ€™t do much because it is a
showcasing website.

## What is your business model? Where is the revenue coming from?
My business model is still a work in progress. I am still deciding between a one-time fee of 0.99$ or a
free basic version and a premium version with more features for 0.99$-1.99$.

## What are the costs of your business?
Website hosting, paying for the iOS app(or learning to code it on my own), and a lot of my own free time
that is used for user testing and designing.

## Who is your current competition?
There is not a lot of competition actually. There are a couple apps that do similar things but no app is as
specific as my app. So, I think this might be something interesting.

## What is the current supply/demand for your product?
From my research neither the supply nor the demand is that high. But I felt the need for it, so if I can
build a solution to my problem, I am sure that a lot of people will find that solution helpful.

# Technical Specifications
## What data will you need to store? How will it be organized? Describe each table, its columns, and its relationship to the other tables.

One table will store email and password. This table only needs 3 columns:
